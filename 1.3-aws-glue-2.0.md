### AWS Glue 2.0

- AWS Glue 2.0 has integrated scheduling and provisioning this means that you:

- 1. Run the Glue Job / Submit the job to the job manager

- 2. The Job manager the submits the job to a virtual cluster (if that v-cluster already has some machines set-up, and it often will, then the job starts immediately)

- 3.The Spark scheduler will start working and ask for tasks to be attached to executors

Note: The job starts when the first executor is ready. This means reduced start time and reduced start variance.
