### AWS::Glue::Classifier

- The AWS::Glue::Classifier resource creates an AWS Glue classifier that categorizes data sources and specifies schemas.

- A classifier reads the data in a data store. If it recognizes the format of the data, it generates a schema. The classifier also returns a certainty number to indicate how certain the format recognition was.


### Custom Classifiers

- AWS Glue provides a set of built-in classifiers, but you can also create custom classifiers. AWS Glue invokes custom classifiers first, in the order that you specify in your crawler definition. Depending on the results that are returned from custom classifiers, AWS Glue might also invoke built-in classifiers. If a classifier returns certainty=1.0 during processing, it indicates that it's 100 percent certain that it can create the correct schema. AWS Glue then uses the output of that classifier.
